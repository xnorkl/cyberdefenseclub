# CCDC PLAYBOOK 2019

Official playbook for AU-ACM Cyber Defense Club 


# Table of Contents

## Primary Goals
CCDC is a yearly blue vs red competition.

The objective: maintain up time of an enterprise network and its primary services all while protecting the network from a professional red team.  

The enterprise network architecture changes each year,
meaning each year team composition should change to meet the challenges presented by the newest iteration of the play field.

## Scoring

## Team Composition
Our team composition this year is a close mapping of the enterprise architecture, with Captain and Change Control Officer designated to carry out tasking injections to any of three teams: Windows, Unix, and Firewall administration.

A(Change Control Officer) --> B(Captain)
C(Windows Team) --> A
D(Linux Team) --> A
E(A/D DNS) --> C
F(Exchange) --> C
G(BIND DNS) --> D
H(E-Commerce) --> D
I(Web Apps) --> D
J(Network Admin) --> A
```

This is a team competition, where coordination and communication are imperative to success.

## The Game Plan
**Injects** and **Incidents** are prioritized.
- Injects correspond to tasks received by the Captain. The entire team is responsible for completing each inject.
- Incidents correspond to primary services taken down by the red team or *otherwise* 

To successfully balance inject completion, incident resolution all while maintaining or improving a security posture, refer to this work flow:

```

## Injects

Injects are most often tasks associated with system administration tasks.
/example inject/

Each team is responsible for: 
- Inject Resolution 
- Proper documentation 
- Commu

## Hardening
There should be no injects given within the first 15 minutes. Hardening each and every device under your purview is the first step that should be taken towards securing a system. Since hardening a system is never completely finished, break hardening up into an initial step and a recurrent process. 

The initial step breaks down neatly into three smaller, consecutive steps:
  	
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. new user passwords
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. configure admin accounts
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. access rights 
**These steps differ slightly per team.*

### - Network Admin 
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Change Default Credentials
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Harden Admin Account
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Define Firewall Rules   

### - Windows Team
&nbsp;&nbsp;**1. Change Default Credentials**
&nbsp;&nbsp;**2. Create an Admin Account**
&nbsp;&nbsp;**3. Restrict Login Access**  

log successful and failed logins
```powershell
auditpol.exe /set /category:"Logon/Logoff"  /success:enable /failure:enable | out-null
```

### - Linux Team
&nbsp;**1. change default user credentials**
```bash
# change default password for default login
passwd
# open a root shell and change root password
sudo -i 
passwd
usermod -l <newname> <oldname>
usermod -d ~/home/<newname> -m <newname>
# symlink $HOME 
ln -s ~/home/<newname> ~/home/<oldname> 
```
&nbsp;**2. add an admin user to the wheel group and lock root**
```bash
# while root create an admin account
useradd -mg wheel <admin>
passwd <admin> 
exit
# login as admin and restrict root login and su to <admin>
sudo -i -u <admin>
sudo passwd -l root 
sudo chown <admin>:wheel /bin/su
```
**Always use sudo -i -u admin when performing admin tasks!*

&nbsp;**3. Restrict Login Access**  
```bash
# 
```



**Administrating the Wheel Group**

Add the wheel group if it doesn't already exist. 
Restrict the use of sudo to the wheel group by configuring **/etc/sudoers**. Use visudo and uncomment the following: 
```bash
wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL  
```
Restrict use of su with pam. 
Uncomment or add the following line to **/etc/pam.d/su**:
```bash
auth		requirement	pam_wheel.so group=wheel
```
**User Administration**
Set a delay upon authentication failure
Lock out a user after 3 repeated failed attempts
```bash
/etc/pam.d/system-login

auth optional pam_faildelay.so delay=4000000
auth required pam_tally2.so deny=3 unlock_time=600 onerr=succeed file=/var/log/tallylog
```
Limit processes run by users
```bash
/etc/security/limits.conf

* soft nproc 100
* hard nproc 200
```
